A Python based interpreter for the Right-reference Pedagogic Algorithmic Language (RPAL) consisting of Lexical Analyzer, Parser, Standardizer, and Control Stack Environment (CSE) Machine.

**Important**

- Don't use `'` for strings and chars in the input, always use `"` instead.
- For function definitions, always keep a space between the function name and the opening parenthesis or function parameters, e.g., `f (x) = x + 1` or `f x = x + 1` instead of `f(x) = x + 1` or `fx = x + 1`.
